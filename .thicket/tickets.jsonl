Add validation in fidlcrs to check if the main compiled library actually matches `expected_library_name`. Ensure errors properly reflect mismatches, identical to the C++ fidlc compiler.","type":"feature","status":"open","priority":3,"labels":null,"assignee":"","created":"2026-02-13T19:09:03.424275054Z","updated":"2026-02-13T19:09:03.424275054Z"}
{"id":"FC-c3jajg","title":"More sophisticated goldens generation","description":"Look at how golden files are specified in fidlc/testdata/BUILD.gn and note how different test libraries are defined with different parameters.\n\nIn particular look at how the following variables vary based on which filenames are being generated:\n - public_deps\n - experimental_flags\n - versioned\n - contains drivers\n\nUpdate generate-goldens.sh so that the same variables are set when we go to compile FIDL libraries. Don't worry about using these values yet.","type":"task","status":"open","priority":2,"labels":null,"assignee":"","created":"2026-02-13T16:26:38.703742626Z","updated":"2026-02-13T16:26:38.703742626Z"}
