The Compiler::Compile() method in fidlc/src/compiler.cc calls each of the steps in a particular order.\n\nUpdate this Rust implementation, fidlcrs, to follow this same pattern. This may mean moving code that's currently directly on the Compiler struct into separate step structs. Features that are not yet supported fidlcrs don't need to be ported over, but put the structure in place so that they can be added later. In fact, if you notice them add thicket tickets to track that work with details you come across.\n\nAs you develop, keep running \"cargo check\" and \"./generate_goldens.sh\" to ensure that we move the structure of the program forward without losing ground on features. Don't enable any additional files in the generate_goldens.sh script - if you need broader tests then file a ticket and we'll come back to it later.","type":"task","status":"closed","priority":0,"labels":null,"assignee":"","created":"2026-02-13T22:46:17.034944967Z","updated":"2026-02-13T22:46:17.034944967Z"}
